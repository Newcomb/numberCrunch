  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>I calculated the mean, median, and mode then portrayed them on my website above.
  I then went further by integrating the reduce method which you can view by inspecting
  the webpage. The reduce method takes one parameter which is another function.
  This other function takes two parameters which the reduce method gives it, these
parameters inculde an accumulator and a current value. The accumulator keeps a running total of
the elements that are pulled in from the array and are added to it. The elements added to the accumulator
are iterated over and come in as the current element. This process eventually returns the total value of all the
elements in the array. To find the mean after the total was calculated I used the length property
to get the to number of elements then divided the total of the elements by the
total number of elements.</p>
